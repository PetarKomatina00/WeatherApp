# Binaries generated by Cargo:
target/

# If you’re using the build artifacts for a specific tool:
**/debug/
**/release/

# If you use an IDE or editor that generates its own files:
.idea/
.vscode/
*.swp   # For Vim swap files, if applicable

# If you have a Cargo.lock in a library crate, you may want to ignore it, 
# but for binary projects it’s usually committed:
# Cargo.lock
